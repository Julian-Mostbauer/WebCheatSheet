        <section>
          <h3>HTTP</h3>
          <p class="info-text">
            The <mark>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</mark> (HTTP) is an
            application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for
            distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is
            the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where
            hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the
            user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping
            the screen in a web browser.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>HTML</h3>

          <p class="info-text">
            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
            defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
            assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and
            scripting languages such as JavaScript.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>URL</h3>

          <p class="info-text">
            URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
            <mark
              >A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource
              on the Web.</mark
            >
            In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such
            resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The URL Syntax:</h3>

          <p class="info-text">
            A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a string of characters that
            identifies a resource on the internet and specifies its location. It
            typically consists of several components, including the protocol
            <mark>(such as "http://" or "https://")</mark>, the domain name
            (like "example.com"), and optionally a path to a specific resource
            on the server ("/page.html"), query parameters (beginning with "?"),
            and fragments (starting with "#") for navigating within the
            resource. The syntax generally follows a hierarchical structure,
            with components separated by specific characters like slashes ("/")
            and colons (":"). Additionally, URLs can include special characters
            encoded using percent-encoding to ensure compatibility and proper
            interpretation by web browsers and servers.

          <h3>Web Servers</h3>

          <p class="info-text">
            A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that
            accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to
            distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent,
            commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by
            making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and
            the server responds with the content of that resource or an error
            message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from
            the user agent if configured to do so. Can store data in caches to
            improve performance, or a database for much storage.
          </p>

          <h3>Web Clients</h3>

          <p class="info-text">
            A web browser is an application for accessing websites and the
            Internet. When a user requests a web page from a particular website,
            the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays
            the page on the user's screen. Browsers are used on a range of
            devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
          </p>

          <h3>How they work:</h3>

          <p class="info-text">
            <mark
              >The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from the World
              Wide Web</mark
            >
            or from local storage and display it on a user's device. This
            process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator
            (URL), such as https://en.wikipedia.org/, into the browser.
            Virtually all URLs are retrieved using the Hypertext Transfer
            Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules for the transfer of data. If the URL
            uses the secure mode of HTTP (HTTPS), the connection between the
            browser and the web server is encrypted for the purposes of
            communications security and information privacy
