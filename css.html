          <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
              language either.
              <strong>CSS is a style sheet language.</strong> CSS is what you
              use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS
              selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:
            </p>
            <div>
              <code>p { color: red; }</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of
              CSS (above) into a new file. Save the file as
              <code>style.css</code> in a directory named <code>styles</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to
              your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the
              appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our
              project, pause here to read Dealing with files and HTML basics.)
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Open your <code >index.html</code> file.
                Paste the following line in the head (between the
                <code >&lt;head&gt;</code> and
                <code >&lt;/head&gt;</code> tags):
                <div>
                  <code
                    >&lt;link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet"
                    /&gt;</code
                  >
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Save <code >index.html</code> and load it in
                your browser. You should see something like this:
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is
              working.

          <h3>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand
              how it works:
            </p>
            <p>
              The whole structure is called a <strong>ruleset</strong>. (The
              term <em>ruleset</em> is often referred to as just <em>rule</em>.)
              Note the names of the individual parts:
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Selector</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It
                  defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example,
                  <code >&lt;p&gt;</code> elements). To style
                  a different element, change the selector.
                </p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Declaration</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  This is a single rule like
                  <code >color: red;</code>. It specifies
                  which of the element's <strong>properties</strong> you want to
                  style.
                </p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Properties</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In
                  this example, <code >color</code> is a
                  property of the
                  <code >&lt;p&gt;</code> elements.) In CSS,
                  you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
                </p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Property value</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the
                  <strong>property value</strong>. This chooses one out of many
                  possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there
                  are many <code >color</code> values in
                  addition to <code >red</code>.)
                </p>
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly
                braces. (<code >{}</code>)
              </li>
              <li>
                Within each declaration, you must use a colon (<code
                  
                  >:</code
                >) to separate the property from its value or values.
              </li>
              <li>
                Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (<code
                  
                  >;</code
                >) to separate each declaration from the next one.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them
              separated by semicolons, like this:
            </p>
            <div>
              <code
                >p { color: red; width: 500px; border: 1px solid black; }</code
              >
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Selecting multiple elements</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset
              to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For
              example:
            </p>
            <div>
              <code>p, li, h1 { color: red; } </code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Different types of selectors</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              There are many different types of selectors. The examples above
              use <strong>element selectors</strong>, which select all elements
              of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well.
              Here are some of the more common types of selectors:
            </p>
            <figure>
              <table>
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="col">Selector name</th>
                    <th scope="col">What does it select</th>
                    <th scope="col">Example</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td>
                      Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)
                    </td>
                    <td>All HTML elements of the specified type.</td>
                    <td>
                      <code >p</code><br />
                      selects <code >&lt;p&gt;</code>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>ID selector</td>
                    <td>
                      The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given
                      HTML page, each id value should be unique.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      <code >#my-id</code><br />
                      selects
                      <code &gt;</code> or
                      <code &gt;</code>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Class selector</td>
                    <td>
                      The element(s) on the page with the specified class.
                      Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      <code >.my-class</code><br />
                      selects
                      <code 
                        >&lt;p &gt;</code
                      >
                      and
                      <code 
                        >&lt;a &gt;</code
                      >
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Attribute selector</td>
                    <td>
                      The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      <code >img[src]</code><br />
                      selects
                      <code 
                        >&lt;img src="myimage.png"&gt;</code
                      >
                      but not <code >&lt;img&gt;</code>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Pseudo-class selector</td>
                    <td>
                      The specified element(s), but only when in the specified
                      state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.)
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      <code >a:hover</code><br />
                      selects <code >&lt;a&gt;</code>, but
                      only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            </figure>
            <p>
              There are many more selectors to discover. To learn more, see the
              MDN Selectors guide.

          <h2>Fonts and text</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Now that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the
              appearance of the example by adding more rules and information to
              the <code>style.css</code> file.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                First, find the output from Google Fonts that you previously
                saved from What will your website look like?. Add the
                <code >&lt;link&gt;</code> element somewhere
                inside your <code >index.html</code>'s head
                (anywhere between the
                <code >&lt;head&gt;</code> and
                <code >&lt;/head&gt;</code> tags). It looks
                something like this:
                <div>
                  <code
                    >&lt;link
                    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans"
                    rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
                  </code>
                </div>
                This code links your page to a style sheet that loads the Open
                Sans font family with your webpage.
              </li>
              <li>
                Next, delete the existing rule you have in your
                <code >style.css</code> file. It was a good
                test, but let's not continue with lots of red text.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the
                <code >font-family</code> assignment with
                your <code >font-family</code> selection from
                What will your website look like?. The property
                <code >font-family</code> refers to the
                font(s) you want to use for text. This rule defines a global
                base font and font size for the whole page. Since
                <code >&lt;html&gt;</code> is the parent
                element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit the
                same <code >font-size</code> and
                <code >font-family</code>.
                <div>
                  <code
                    >html { font-size: 10px; /* px means "pixels": the base font
                    size is now 10 pixels high */ font-family: "Open Sans",
                    sans-serif; /* this should be the rest of the output you got
                    from Google Fonts */ }
                  </code>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Anything in CSS between
                    <code >/*</code> and
                    <code >*/</code> is a
                    <strong>CSS comment</strong>. The browser ignores comments
                    as it renders the code. CSS comments are a way for you to
                    write helpful notes about your code or logic.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Now let's set font sizes for elements that will have text inside
                the HTML body (&lt;h1&gt;,
                <code >&lt;li&gt;</code>, and
                <code >&lt;p&gt;</code>). We'll also center
                the heading. Finally, let's expand the second ruleset (below)
                with settings for line height and letter spacing to make body
                content more readable.
                <div>
                  <code
                    >h1 { font-size: 60px; text-align: center; } p, li {
                    font-size: 16px; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 1px; }
                  </code>
                </div>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Adjust the <code >px</code> values as you like.
              Your work-in-progress should look similar to this:
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>CSS: all about boxes</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about
              boxes. This includes setting size, color, and position. Most HTML
              elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of
              other boxes.
            </p>

              CSS layout is mostly based on the <em>box model.</em> Each box
              taking up space on your page has properties like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code >padding</code>, the space around the
                content. In the example below, it is the space around the
                paragraph text.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code >border</code>, the solid line that is
                just outside the padding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code >margin</code>, the space around the
                outside of the border.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this section we also use:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code >width</code> (of an element).</li>
              <li>
                <code >background-color</code>, the color
                behind an element's content and padding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code >color</code>, the color of an
                element's content (usually text).
              </li>
              <li>
                <code >text-shadow</code> sets a drop shadow
                on the text inside an element.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code >display</code> sets the display mode
                of an element. (keep reading to learn more)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To continue, let's add more CSS. Keep adding these new rules at
              the bottom of <code >style.css</code>.
              Experiment with changing values to see what happens.

          <h3>Changing the page color</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <code>html { background-color: #00539f; } </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This rule sets a background color for the entire page. Change the
              color code to the color you chose in What will my website look
              like?.

          <h3>Styling the body</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <code
                >body { width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; background-color: #ff9500;
                padding: 0 20px 20px 20px; border: 5px solid black; }
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              There are several declarations for the
              <code >&lt;body&gt;</code> element. Let's go
              through these line-by-line:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code >width: 600px;</code> This forces the
                body to always be 600 pixels wide.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code >margin: 0 auto;</code> When you set
                two values on a property like
                <code >margin</code> or
                <code >padding</code>, the first value
                affects the element's top <em>and</em> bottom side (setting it
                to <code >0</code> in this case); the second
                value affects the left <em>and</em> right side. (Here,
                <code >auto</code> is a special value that
                divides the available horizontal space evenly between left and
                right). You can also use one, two, three, or four values, as
                documented in Margin Syntax.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code >background-color: #FF9500;</code> This
                sets the element's background color. This project uses a reddish
                orange for the body background color, as opposed to dark blue
                for the <code >&lt;html&gt;</code> element.
                (Feel free to experiment.)
              </li>
              <li>
                <code >padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;</code> This
                sets four values for padding. The goal is to put some space
                around the content. In this example, there is no padding on the
                top of the body, and 20 pixels on the right, bottom and left.
                The values set top, right, bottom, left, in that order. As with
                <code >margin</code>, you can use one, two,
                three, or four values, as documented in Padding Syntax.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code >border: 5px solid black;</code> This
                sets values for the width, style and color of the border. In
                this case, it's a five-pixel–wide, solid black border, on all
                sides of the body.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Positioning and styling the main page title</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <code
                >h1 { margin: 0; padding: 20px 0; color: #00539f; text-shadow:
                3px 3px 1px black; }
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              You may have noticed there's a horrible gap at the top of the
              body. That happens because browsers apply default styling to the
              h1 element (among others). That might seem like a bad idea, but
              the intent is to provide basic readability for unstyled pages. To
              eliminate the gap, we overwrite the browser's default styling with
              the setting <code >margin: 0;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, we set the heading's top and bottom padding to 20 pixels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following that, we set the heading text to be the same color as
              the HTML background color.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, <code >text-shadow</code> applies a
              shadow to the text content of the element. Its four values are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The first pixel value sets the
                <strong>horizontal offset</strong> of the shadow from the text:
                how far it moves across.
              </li>
              <li>
                The second pixel value sets the
                <strong>vertical offset</strong> of the shadow from the text:
                how far it moves down.
              </li>
              <li>
                The third pixel value sets the <strong>blur radius</strong> of
                the shadow. A larger value produces a more fuzzy-looking shadow.
              </li>
              <li>The fourth value sets the base color of the shadow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Try experimenting with different values to see how it changes the
              appearance.

          <h3>Centering the image</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <code>img { display: block; margin: 0 auto; } </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Next, we center the image to make it look better. We could use the
              <code >margin: 0 auto</code> trick again as we
              did for the body. But there are differences that require an
              additional setting to make the CSS work.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code >&lt;body&gt;</code> is a
              <strong>block</strong> element, meaning it takes up space on the
              page. The margin applied to a block element will be respected by
              other elements on the page. In contrast, images are
              <strong>inline</strong> elements, for the auto margin trick to
              work on this image, we must give it block-level behavior using
              <code >display: block;</code>.
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> The instructions above assume that you're
                using an image smaller than the width set on the body. (600
                pixels) If your image is larger, it will overflow the body,
                spilling into the rest of the page. To fix this, you can either:
                1) reduce the image width using a graphics editor, or 2) use CSS
                to size the image by setting the
                <code >width</code> property on the
                <code >&lt;img&gt;</code> element with a
                smaller value.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Don't be too concerned if you don't
                completely understand
                <code >display: block;</code> or the
                differences between a block element and an inline element. It
                will make more sense as you continue your study of CSS. You can
                find more information about different display values on MDN's
                display reference page.
